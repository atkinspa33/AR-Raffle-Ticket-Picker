# AR-Raffle-Ticket-Picker
**Abbey Road raffle ticket picker. It lets a user pick out winning tickets repeatedly from a set of sold raffle tickets.**

There are 4 possible ticket colours supported: _pink_, _green_, _yellow_, and _white_.

## Usage
The user will be asked for the last ticket number sold from each of the 4 colours.<br/>
Picking will then be a random selection from the pooled set of tickets sold.
N.b. it makes the assumption that all tickets up to the 'last ticket number' were sold (so no spoiled tickets and ticket number started at #1).

If no tickets for a certain colour were sold enter "0" for that colour.

## Possible Improvements for KingCobra
1. Ability for users to define their own ticket colours at the start.
2. Ability for users to define starting numbers for each ticket colour and maybe an option to enter specific ticket numbers that were lost/damaged.
3. Add some suspense by adding some fake ticket selection graphics.
